## Journal Reflection

### Project Overview
For this project, I worked on creating and training an intelligent pirate agent for a treasure hunt game.  
The goal was for the pirate to navigate a maze filled with obstacles and successfully reach the treasure.  
I was provided with some starter code, including the environment setup in **`TreasureMaze.py`** and the memory system in **`GameExperience.py`**.  
I was also given a Jupyter Notebook that included the overall structure and some guidance.  
My role was to complete the deep Q-learning implementation, which included writing the training loop, handling exploration and exploitation,  
and building the neural network updates that allowed the pirate to learn from experience.  

### Connection to Computer Science
This project showed me how my learning connects to the larger field of computer science.  
At its core, computer science is about solving problems with algorithms, data, and systems.  
Computer scientists design tools and technologies that improve efficiency, expand possibilities, and impact society in meaningful ways.  
Reinforcement learning, which I applied here, is not only used in games but also in robotics, navigation, healthcare,  
and many other real-world applications.  

### Problem-Solving Approach
I learned to approach the problem step by step.  
Instead of making the pirate agent “smart” immediately, I started with setting up the reward system, then built the neural network,  
and finally tuned factors like the learning rate and epsilon decay.  
This experimental, iterative approach mirrors how computer scientists tackle larger and more complex projects.  

### Ethical Responsibilities
This project also made me reflect on ethics in intelligent system design.  
Even though this was just a game, reinforcement learning is used in fields that directly affect human lives.  
As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to ensure systems are **reliable, fair, and safe**.  
That includes protecting user data, avoiding bias in training, and making systems transparent and inclusive.  
For organizations, it also means thinking about the long-term effects of technology on society.  

### Final Reflection
Completing this project demonstrated how AI can be applied to decision-making problems and reinforced the balance between **innovation and responsibility**.  
It was a valuable learning experience and a clear example of how reinforcement learning and neural networks can be used to address real-world challenges.
