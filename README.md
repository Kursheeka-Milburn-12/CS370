## Journal Reflection
For this project, I worked on creating and training an intelligent pirate agent for a treasure hunt game. The goal was for the pirate to navigate a maze filled with obstacles and successfully reach the treasure. I was provided with some starter code, including the environment setup in TreasureMaze.py and the memory system in GameExperience.py. I was also given a Jupyter Notebook that included the overall structure and some guidance. My role was to complete the deep Q-learning implementation, which included writing the training loop, handling exploration and exploitation, and building the neural network updates that allowed the pirate to learn from experience.
This project helped me see how the skills I have been learning throughout this course connect to the larger field of computer science. At its core, computer science is about solving problems through algorithms, data, and systems. Computer scientists create tools and technologies that improve efficiency, expand possibilities, and make an impact on society. Reinforcement learning, which I used here, is not just useful in games, it is also used in robotics, navigation, healthcare, and many other real-world applications.
Working through this project showed me how to approach problems as a computer scientist. I learned to break a major challenge down into smaller steps, trying out all possibilities and fine-tuning the solution with time. For example, instead of trying to make the pirate agent "smart" from the very start, I focused on setting up the reward system to start, then setting up the neural net model, and finally tweaking things like learning rate and epsilon decay. This gradual, experimental process is precisely what computer scientists apply to much more general and larger-scale projects.
The reason that I began reflecting on the ethical responsibilities in the design of intelligent systems would have to do with the fact that this was just a game. But reinforcement learning is applied in spaces that have immediate consequences for human lives. As a computer scientist, I have an obligation to make sure systems are reliable, fair, and safe. This means protecting user data, preventing training from being biased, and ensuring that systems are transparent and inclusive. For organizations, it also means considering the impact of technology over the long term on humans and society at large.
This completion of the project illustrated to me how artificial intelligence can be implemented in decision-making problems and how much balance there is between innovation and responsibility. A valuable learning experience and a prime example of how the applications of reinforcement learning and neural networks can address real-life challenges.
